# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard is a large company boasting several thousand employees and it's been around for a long time.
It is looking toward the future in two ways.  First, it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria.
Second, it's starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the  near future. 
The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings.
This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package.
The epployee data we need is only available in the form of six CSV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data.
Our task is to build an employee databasee with SQL.
In this assignment we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to 
help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."
